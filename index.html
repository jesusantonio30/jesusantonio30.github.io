            <p>
                Hello world! I am a 22 year old Welder pursuing a career as a Web Developer. My hobbies
                include spending quality time with my girlfriend of 6+ years, One Piece, watching/reading anime,
                and going to the gym. To be honest, I'm afraid of pursuing this career path so the excuse I like
                to use is that I'm doing it as a hobby. However, just like Luffy isn't afraid of saying his dream 
                outloud, I won't be either. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I will become a Web Developer!
